# restd

Pure functional Erlang combinator library for building HTTP services.

## Inspiration


The modern functional rest frameworks uses pure functions to define a request routing. The web-machine uses a object-oriented approach to define routing. Please see examples of pure functional rest api frameworks finch (https://finagle.github.io/finch/cookbook.html), akka-http (https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/routing-dsl/index.html).
